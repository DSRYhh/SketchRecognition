==========================================
The Pattern Recognition and Image Processing (PRIP) Hand-Drawn Composite (PRIP-HDC) database used in the paper [1] contains 265 hand-drawn composites togethr with the mated mugshots. These hand-draw composites are drawn based on the verbal description by the eyewitness or victim; so they are completely different from the othe public-domain sketch databases such as CUHK sketch database [2], which are drawn by looking at the photo.

Of the 265 total hand-drawn composites, 73 were drawn by Lois Gibson [2], 43 were drawn by Karen Taylor [3], 56 were provided bythe Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office (PCSO), 46 were drawn by forensic artists employed by the Michigan State Police, and 47 were downloaded from the Internet.

Due to the intellectual property (IP) issue, currently we are not able to release all the 265 composites, except for the 47 hand-drawn composites publicly availabe from the Internet. This released dataset contain 47 pairs of hand-drawn composites-mugshot pairs.
